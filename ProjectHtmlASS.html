                <p style="text-indent:2%; ">The origin of Jollof Rice is traceable to 
                    the Jollof tribe in the 
                    Senegambia region of West Africa.
                    Jollof rice is also called Benachin√¢ in the Wolof language.
                   In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. 
                   Most Nigerian Parties serve Jollof rice as the main dish and to be 
                   honest the color of the jollof rice matters
                   a lot to me, if it's dull, i don't want to even know what it tastes like,
                   if it's bright, I'M GAME!!.

                <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size: small;">Let me show you how to make Jollof Rice in 5 easy steps</h4>
                <p style="text-indent:2%; ">There are many different ways to cook Jollof Rice. 
                    It is a dish made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, red bell pepper, scotch bonnet peppers, 
                    salt, and spices. If it doesn't have the above mentioned ingredients, then it's not true Jollof. 
                    I make it the way my mum taught me, and I usually call it Nigerian Jollof 
                    because of the type of the rice that is used. 
                    Nigerians use the long grain rice that has been parboiled. Other versions i.e. 
                    Ghanaian Jollof will use basmati or jasmine rice.

            <h4><b>Instructions</b></h4>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a 
                food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.
            </li>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. 
                Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown.
                 Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. 
                 Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and 
                 fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. 
                Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.
            </li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock.
                 Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, 
                all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). 
                Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. 
                At this point if you need to add water so that 
                the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken 
                stock go ahead and do so.
                 Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, 
                    and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. 
                    Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
            </li>
